# Siri-Like-Chatbot-in-ROS

Built a ROS package to make a robot interactive using
artificial intelligence. Using this package, we can talk to a robot and the robot can answer
your queries, like human-to-human interaction. We built this
communication system using AIML, which is the main component of this project. We
used AIML tags, worked with AIML files using Python, and ultimately,
built a ROS package based on AIML for an interactive robot.
